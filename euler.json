For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107. \r\n A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65. \r\n For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes.

Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution. \r\n In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail. \r\n At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square. \r\n \r\n Community Chest (2/16 cards):\r\n \r\n Advance to GO \r\n Go to JAIL \r\n \r\n \r\n Chance (10/16 cards):\r\n \r\n Advance to GO \r\n Go to JAIL \r\n Go to C1 \r\n Go to E3 \r\n Go to H2 \r\n Go to R1 \r\n Go to next R (railway company) \r\n Go to next R \r\n Go to next U (utility company) \r\n Go back 3 squares. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between &quot;Just Visiting&quot; and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to &quot;get out of jail&quot;, assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn. \r\n By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares. \r\n Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400. \r\n If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.",

Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 0 0 3 9 0 0 0 0 1 \r\n 0 2 0 3 0 5 8 0 6 \r\n 6 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 \r\n \r\n \r\n 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 6 \r\n 1 0 2 0 0 0 7 0 8 \r\n 9 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 \r\n \r\n \r\n 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 0 5 \r\n 6 0 9 2 0 3 0 1 0 \r\n 5 0 0 0 0 9 3 0 0 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 4 8 3 9 6 7 2 5 1 \r\n 9 2 1 3 4 5 8 7 6 \r\n 6 5 7 8 2 1 4 9 3 \r\n \r\n \r\n 5 4 8 7 2 9 1 3 6 \r\n 1 3 2 5 6 4 7 9 8 \r\n 9 7 6 1 3 8 2 4 5 \r\n \r\n \r\n 3 7 2 8 1 4 6 9 5 \r\n 6 8 9 2 5 3 4 1 7 \r\n 5 1 4 7 6 9 3 8 2 \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ &quot;guess and test&quot; methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered  easy  because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction. \r\n The 6K text file,  sudoku.txt  (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above). \r\n By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above. \r\n<!-- Note: If you're convinced that &quot;guess and test&quot; methods need not be employed please tell how you would solve #6 and #46.

However, it is normal to play a &quot;doubles out&quot; system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is &quot;bust&quot;. \r\n When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a &quot;checkout&quot; and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull). \r\n There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n   D3 \r\n   &nbsp; \r\n   &nbsp; \r\n \r\n \r\n D1 \r\n D2 \r\n &nbsp; \r\n \r\n \r\n S2 \r\n D2 \r\n &nbsp; \r\n \r\n \r\n D2 \r\n D1 \r\n &nbsp; \r\n \r\n \r\n S4 \r\n D1 \r\n &nbsp; \r\n \r\n \r\n S1 \r\n S1 \r\n D2 \r\n \r\n \r\n S1 \r\n T1 \r\n D1 \r\n \r\n \r\n S1 \r\n S3 \r\n D1 \r\n \r\n \r\n D1 \r\n D1 \r\n D1 \r\n \r\n \r\n D1 \r\n S2 \r\n D1 \r\n \r\n \r\n S2 \r\n S2 \r\n D1 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Note that D1 D2 is considered  different  to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles.

Thus, there are 2  n   distinct proteins consisting of  n  elements. \r\n\r\n When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous. \r\nAs a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside. \r\nNatural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in  two dimensions . \r\n\r\n The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots). \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally. \r\nOn the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string. \r\n\r\n Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 8 =3.3203125. \r\n\r\n What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15? \r\nGive your answer using as many decimal places as necessary for an exact result.",

Number \" 8 \" lights them all. \r\n\r\n The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off. \r\nTo turn on a \" 2 \" will cost 5 transitions, while a \" 7 \" will cost only 4 transitions. \r\n\r\n Sam and Max built two different clocks. \r\n\r\n Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \" 137 \", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (\" 11 \") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (\" 2 \") is turned on and, after some time, off. \r\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires: \r\n  \r\n \" 137 \" \r\n : \r\n (2 + 5 + 4) &times; 2 = 22 transitions (\" 137 \" on/off). \r\n  \r\n \" 11 \" \r\n : \r\n (2 + 2) &times; 2 = 8 transitions (\" 11 \" on/off). \r\n  \r\n \" 2 \" \r\n : \r\n (5) &times; 2 = 10 transitions (\" 2 \" on/off). \r\n  \r\nFor a grand total of 40 transitions. \r\n\r\n Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number. \r\nFor number 137, Max's clock requires: \r\n  \r\n \" 137 \"   \r\n :   \r\n 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\" 137 \" on) \r\n7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number \" 11 \"). \r\n  \r\n \" 11 \"    \r\n :    \r\n 0 transitions (number \" 11 \" is already turned on correctly) \r\n3 transitions (to turn off the first \" 1 \" and the bottom part of the second \" 1 \";  \r\nthe top part is common with number \" 2 \"). \r\n  \r\n \" 2 \"   \r\n :   \r\n 4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a \" 2 \") \r\n5 transitions (to turn off number \" 2 \"). \r\n  \r\nFor a grand total of 30 transitions. \r\n\r\n Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one. \r\nThe two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 10 7  and B = 2&times;10 7 .  \r\nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.",

A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked.

E.g. \r\n\r\n If  n =3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \" 2 \". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2). \r\n\r\n If  n =8, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our first question would be \" 4 \" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions. \r\nLet our second question be \" 6 \". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8. \r\nThus, our third question will be \" 7 \" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=  17  . \r\n\r\n We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for  n =8, by asking \" 5 \" as our first question. \r\nIf we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be \" 7 \", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=  12  ). \r\nIf we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be \" 3 \" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be \" 1 \", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=  9  . \r\nSince   12  >  9  , the worst-case cost for this strategy is   12  .

Then,\r\n \r\n If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free. \r\n If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s). \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\r\n \r\n Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.98 5  = 0.9039207968. \r\n Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 &times; 5 = 1.480396016.<br/>\r\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 &times; 5 =  7.40198008  tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\r\n \r\n We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases. \r\n If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected). \r\n We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised. \r\n \r\n \r\nTo simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\r\n \r\nFor the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the  optimal strategy ) requires an average of just  4.155452  tests!\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T( s , p ) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of  s  sheep for a virus having probability  p  to be present in any individual.<br/>\r\nThus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nFind &Sigma;T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.<br/>\r\nGive your answer rounded to six decimal places.",

    "431": "Square Space Silo   Problem 431  Published on Sunday, 9th June 2013, 10:00 am; Solved by 330; Difficulty rating: 40%  \r\n \r\n Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property. \r\n\r\n Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m 3 . However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture. \r\n\r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \\approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \\approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain. \r\n\r\n Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it. \r\n\r\n If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places.",

If  t  = 0, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn  i , the player rolls a die. After rolling, if  i  &lt;  t  the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If  i  =  t , then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins,  t  is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost  ct  for some constant  c . For  c  = 0,  t  can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R( d ,  c ) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair  d -sided die and cost constant  c . For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs. \r\n\r\n Now consider a game of Super Ramvok: \r\n\r\n In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank. \r\n\r\n Let S( d ,  c ) be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair  d -sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant  c .

On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let S( k ) represent chef # k 's skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, S( k ) is the probability that chef # k 's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns).

The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions: \r\n\r\n \r\n Only one disk can be moved at a time. \r\n A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod). \r\n No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk. \r\n \r\n\r\n Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room  k  units (square tiles) wide, labeled from 1 to  k  in ascending order.

Instead, Bob, one of her friends, sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen numbers are bigger than the number which he is seeing. \r\n(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left, she is forced to end the game.  \r\n\r\n Let F( n ) be the Alice's expected score if she takes the optimized strategy to  minimize  her score. \r\n\r\n For example, F(3) = 5/3.
